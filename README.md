# PaulShields.dev

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Pkshields/PaulShields.dev.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/Pkshields/PaulShields.dev)

This is simply the source and GitHub Pages repo for my portfolio website, [PaulShields.dev](https://paulshields.dev).

## Development

#### Run local server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Lint the source files

Run a static analysis check over the source files by executing `ng lint`.

## Deployment

Deployment should not be done via a local dev machine and should only executed by the [CI server](https://circleci.com/gh/Pkshields/PaulShields.dev). The deployment key, as well as other deployment configuration options, are stored as environment variables against the project on the CI server.
